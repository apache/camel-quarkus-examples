Actually, the insurance has reimbursed only half the money I have spent due to the accident.\nOperator: Hello John, could you please give me your last name so that I can find your contract.\nCustomer: Sure, my surname is Doe.\nOperator: And last thing, I need to know the date you were born.\nCustomer: Yes, so I was born in 2001, actually during the first day of November.\nOperator: Great, I see your contract now. Actually, the full reimbursement option has been cancelled automatically by our system. This explain the half reimbursement.\nCustomer: Ah damn, this is not acceptable. I've not even been notified about this automatic change.\nOperator: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that but the full reimbursement option was free for one year and at the time of subscription you were not interested in automatic renewal.\nCustomer: I don't discuss that. The important fact is that I should have been notified.\nOperator: Sure, I understand your resentment. The best I can do is to inform my manager.\nCustomer: OK, let's do that. Good bye.\nOperator: Good bye. And again let me apologize for the issue."
