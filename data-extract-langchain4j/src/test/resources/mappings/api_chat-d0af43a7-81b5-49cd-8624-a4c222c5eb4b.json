Actually, the full reimbursement option has been cancelled automatically by our system. This explain the half reimbursement.\\nCustomer: Ah damn, this is not acceptable.

The important fact is that I should have been notified.\\nOperator: Sure, I understand your resentment. The best I can do is to inform my manager.\\nCustomer: OK, let's do that.
